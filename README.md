### Chrome
You can install it by downloading the zip file [here](https://github.com/henrystern/DistractionFreeCFA/releases/latest) and following the instructions [here](https://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system).

Chrome makes developers pay a $5 registration fee to list on their store. You don't need to be a charterholder to know that's a bad deal.
